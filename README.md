##📌 Project Overview

The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is an interactive business intelligence solution designed to analyze and visualize road accident data across multiple dimensions such as severity, vehicle type, road type, lighting conditions, weather, and time. The dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly identify trends, risk factors, and high-impact areas to support data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements.

This project is suitable for use by transportation authorities, policy makers, analysts, and researchers seeking actionable insights from large-scale accident datasets.

##🎯 Dashboard Objectives

Provide a consolidated view of road accident casualties

Compare year-over-year (CY vs PY) accident trends

Identify high-risk vehicle types, road types, and conditions

Enable interactive filtering for deeper analysis

Present insights in a clear, visually intuitive format

##🎨 Logo Design & Visual Identity Analysis

The dashboard logo and visual elements are designed to clearly communicate the project’s purpose and ensure usability:

Logo Concept: A vehicle collision icon is used to instantly represent road accidents and safety analysis.

Color Palette: Warm tones (orange, red, yellow) are applied to highlight severity and risk, while neutral backgrounds ensure readability.

Iconography: Vehicle and chart icons are used consistently to enhance data interpretation and reduce cognitive load.

Layout Design: A card-based layout organizes KPIs and charts, making the dashboard intuitive and professional.


The overall design emphasizes clarity, urgency, and analytical focus, which is critical for safety-related data.
